## Development setup guide

### Step 1: Clone & install

```
git clone https://github.com/PictureElement/nextjs-strapi-portfolio-starter.git
cd nextjs-strapi-portfolio-starter
npm run setup  # Installs dependencies for both Next.js and Strapi
```

### Step 2: Configure Strapi

Navigate to the `/strapi/` directory and create `.env` file (use `.env.example` as template):

```
# Server
HOST="localhost"
PORT=1337

# Secrets
APP_KEYS="toBeModified1,toBeModified2,toBeModified3,toBeModified4"
API_TOKEN_SALT="toBeModified"
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET="toBeModified"
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT="toBeModified"
JWT_SECRET="toBeModified"
```

Notes:

- Since this is a development environment, you can leave the default placeholder values as they are—no modifications are needed.
- The placeholder secrets are only for local development and should never be used in production.

### Step 3: Restore the configuration dump

Navigate to the `/strapi/` directory and restore configuration:

```
npm run strapi config:restore --file backup/config.json
```

### Step 4: Import demo (optional)

Navigate to the `/strapi/` directory and import demo:

```
npm run strapi import -- --file backup/data.tar.gz
```

### Step 5: Start Strapi

Navigate to the `/strapi/` directory and start Strapi:

```
npm run develop
```

### Step 6: Create API tokens

i. Access admin at `http://localhost:1337/admin`

ii. Create your first admin user

iii. Generate API tokens (*Settings → API Tokens*):

| Token Name              | Type       | Permissions               |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| `READ-ONLY-TOKEN`       | Read-only  | All content types         |
| `FORM-TOKEN`            | Custom     | Lead → Create only       |

iv. Note down the tokens for later use.

### Step 7: Configure Next.js

i. Set up environment variables

Keep Strapi running, then open another terminal, navigate to the `/next/` directory, and create a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as template):

```
# Public URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI="http://localhost:1337" # URL for the Strapi backend (default: localhost)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE="http://localhost:3000" # URL for the website frontend (default: localhost)

# Encoded Contact Information
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_ENCODED="am9obmRvZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ==" # Base64-encoded email address (e.g., johndoe@example.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEPHONE_ENCODED="KzEgKDU1NSkgMTIzLTQ1Njc=" # Base64-encoded telephone number (e.g., +1 (555) 123-4567)

# API Tokens
STRAPI_READ_ONLY_TOKEN="your_generated_token" # Replace with your generated Strapi API token
STRAPI_FORM_TOKEN="your_generated_token" # Replace with your generated Strapi API token
```

Replace `your_generated_token` with the API tokens you created in the previous step. For the remaining placeholder values, you can leave them as-is since this is a development environment—no further modifications are required.

ii. Customize Tailwind CSS colors (optional)

Update your color palette in `/next/tailwind.config.js` to match your design preferences. Below is an example configuration:

```
colors: {
  secondary: '#E81547',
  primary: {
    '50': '#effef1',
    '100': '#d9ffde',
    '200': '#b5fdbe',
    '300': '#7cf98e',
    '400': '#3cec55',
    '500': '#13d430',
    '600': '#0ac526',
    '700': '#0b8a1e',
    '800': '#0f6c1e',
    '900': '#0e591c',
    '950': '#01320a',
  },
},
```

To generate a custom color scale for your primary color, use a Tailwind CSS color generator tool such as [UI Colors](https://uicolors.app/). Select your desired primary color and create a gradient scale ranging from `50` to `950`.

The secondary color is used primarily for the ring focus of focusable elements, such as buttons, input fields, and links, to enhance accessibility and visual feedback during navigation. Choose a secondary color that complements the primary color while offering sufficient contrast.

### Step 8: Start Next.js

Navigate to the `/next/` directory and start Next.js:

```
npm run dev
```

Website will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Quick start (optional)

To launch both Strapi and Next.js simultaneously from the root directory:

```
npm run dev  # Starts both apps in parallel
```

## Production setup guide (Coolify + Hetzner Cloud VPS)

### Prerequisites

✅ SSH access to Coolify server:

- You have SSH credentials (username + key/password) to the host running Coolify.
- Test access: `ssh deploy@your-coolify-server-ip`.

✅ Directory permissions on Coolify host:

- Ensure you can create/modify directories on the Coolify server (e.g., `/home/strapi/src`).

### Introduction

This guide demonstrates configuring a production environment using Coolify—an open-source, self-hosted Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) alternative to managed platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and Heroku. Designed for developers seeking full infrastructure control, Coolify simplifies deployment workflows while eliminating reliance on third-party cloud services.

### Disclaimer

- Coolify is currently in public beta, and while it provides powerful CI/CD automation and deployment workflows, its stability should be carefully evaluated for critical production workloads. If stability is a concern, you can always opt for more established managed services like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku.

- For this tutorial, we'll use a Hetzner Cloud VPS as our hosting platform. I'm not affiliated with Hetzner—it's chosen purely for its cost-effective performance-to-price ratio, though alternatives like AWS Lightsail or DigitalOcean would work similarly. Coolify's self-hosted nature allows flexibility in VPS provider selection.

### Step 1: VPS & Coolify setup

Follow CJ Reynolds' [Coolify Crash Course](https://youtu.be/taJlPG82Ucw) on the [Syntax](https://www.youtube.com/@syntaxfm) YouTube channel to configure Coolify on a Hetzner Cloud VPS server. The tutorial covers essential steps such as SSH setup, firewall configuration, reverse proxy settings, SSL termination, and more.

### Step 2: Strapi setup

> If you encounter errors such as "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" when accessing the admin dashboard during this step, try clearing your browser's cache and performing a hard reload. 

**i. Create a Strapi resource**

- In the Coolify dashboard, go to "Projects".
- Create a new project (or select an existing one).
- Under your chosen project, add a new resource.
- Search for the *Strapi* template (based on the `elestio/strapi-development` image).

**ii. Set the Node environment**

- In the resource settings, find "Strapi Node Environment".
- Set it to `production` to ensure Strapi runs in production mode.

**iii. Update Docker Compose**

In the resource configuration, modify the Docker Compose file to ensure the Strapi volumes are defined as follows:

```
volumes:
  - '/home/strapi/backup:/opt/app/backup'
  - '/home/strapi/src:/opt/app/src'
  - 'strapi-uploads:/opt/app/public'
  - 'strapi-config:/opt/app/config'
```

Note: The first two lines create a bind mount to allow direct file access between host and container. This is useful for managing backups or restoring data without needing to access the container directly.

**iv. Copy backup and source files to remote host**

Navigate to the local `/strapi/` directory and use the following `rsync` commands to synchronize the `backup` and `src` directories between local and production:

```
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /path/to/private_key" backup/ root@<server-ip>:/home/strapi/backup/
```
```
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /path/to/private_key" src/ root@<server-ip>:/home/strapi/src/
```

Replace `<server-ip>` and `/path/to/private_key` with your server IP and private key path.

**v. Deploy Strapi**

- Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process.
- Wait for the deployment to finish.

**vi. Update local and remote Strapi to the same version**

To update local Strapi, navigate to the local `/strapi/` directory and run:

```
npx @strapi/upgrade latest
```

To update remote Strapi, access the Strapi container's terminal (via Coolify) and run:

```
npx @strapi/upgrade latest
```

**vii. Restore Strapi schemas & configuration on production**

*A one-time transfer of content types and configuration from localhost to production.*

Access the Strapi container's terminal (via Coolify) and restore the configuration dump:

```
npm run strapi config:restore -- --file backup/config.json
```

**viii. Migrate demo content to production (optional)**

*Securely migrate content (entries, media) from from localhost to production.*

<u>Method 1:</u>

Access the Strapi container's terminal (via Coolify) and import data from the backup directory:

```
npm run strapi import -- --file backup/data.tar.gz
```

<u>Method 2:</u>

- Log in to your production Strapi admin panel (`https://<your-strapi-domain>/admin`).
- Go to *Settings → Transfer Tokens → Create New Transfer Token*.
- Name the token (e.g., "Local to Prod Transfer"), set an expiration date and give it full access.
- Copy the generated token.
- Navigate to your local Strapi directory (`/strapi/`) and run the transfer command:  

    ```
    npm run strapi transfer -- --to https://<your-strapi-domain>.com/admin --to-token YOUR_TRANSFER_TOKEN
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_TRANSFER_TOKEN` with the token.

### Step 3: GitHub integration

i. In Coolify dashboard navigate to *Sources* and add a new GitHub App. Name the app and register the webhook endpoint (make sure to use `https://`).

ii. Proceed with the creation of the GitHub App on GitHub's authorization page.

iii. After returning to Coolify, click *Install Repositories on GitHub* and select the `next-strapi-portfolio` repository to authorize access.

### Step 4: Next.js deployment

**i. Create your Strapi API tokens**

- Access Strapi admin at `https://<your-strapi-domain>/admin`
- Generate API tokens (*Settings → API Tokens*):
    | Token Name              | Type       | Permissions               |
    |-------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
    | `READ-ONLY-TOKEN`       | Read-only  | All content types         |
    | `FORM-TOKEN`            | Custom     | Leads → Create only       |
- Note down the tokens for later use.

**ii. Create a Next.js resource**

In Coolify dashboard navigate to *Projects* and create a new project (or select an existing one). Under the project, add a new resource. Select the *Private Repository (with GitHub App)* type, choose the `next-strapi-portfolio` repository and load it.

**iii. Production configuration**

- Under *Configuration/General* configure the following settings:
  - Build Pack: Nixpacks
  - Domains: `https://<your-nextjs-domain>`
  - Install Command: `npm install`
  - Build Command: `npm run build`
  - Start Command: `npm run start`
  - Base Directory: `/next`
  - Publish Directory: `/next`
  - Watch Paths: `next/**`

- Under *Configuration/Environment Variables* add the following variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI=https://<your-strapi-domain>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE=https://<your-nextjs-domain>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_ENCODED=<your-base64-encoded-version-of-your-email>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEPHONE_ENCODED=<your-base64-encoded-version-of-your-telephone>`
  - `STRAPI_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=<api-token-from-step-i>`
  - `STRAPI_FORM_TOKEN=<form-token-from-step-i>`

**iv. Deploy Next.js**

Click *Deploy* to deploy Next.js in production.
